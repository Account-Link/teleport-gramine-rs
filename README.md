## Disclaimers

This is not production code. It has not been audited. It is a provocative stunt! Use it at your own risk.

We are demonstrating a security-motivated *design*, which is all about using TEE to minimize trust in the server. Eventually it could even be run as a completely decentralized p2p network. But for now weâ€™re simply hosting this ourselves.  Although instructions to auditors can be found in AUDITING.md, we have not yet commissioned any professional audit.

This is the last time we write anything in Gramine-SGX. Onward to TDX!
